## 🛠 Stack & Structure

| Area        | Stack                            |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Frontend    | React + TypeScript + Vite       |
| Styling     | TailwindCSS (v4)                |
| Charting    | Recharts                        |

  mocking/         # Mock data for chart
  types/           # Shared interfaces (e.g. AssetPoint)
```
